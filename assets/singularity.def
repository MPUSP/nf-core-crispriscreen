    Recipe for singularity container that bundles a conda environment for fitness analysis as part
    of the 'nf-core-crispriscreen' pipeline.
    For more information, see https://github.com/MPUSP/nf-core-crispriscreen

    To build this container, run:
    'singularity build --fakeroot nf-core-crispriscreen-fitness.sif assets/singularity.def'
